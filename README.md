This is a fork of [Magnus Hallin](https://github.com/mhallin)'s awesome 
[GraphQL-Docs](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql-docs).

Here's what's new:
* Implement [Fatih Kadir Akın](https://github.com/f)'s fix adding support for Union Type
* Group types by definition (Object, Input, Interface, etc.)
* Sort types within each grouping alphabetically
* Add a header for each grouping (with link)
* Add fixed side navigation 
* Implement search with autocomplete using 
[react-typeahead](https://github.com/fmoo/react-typeahead)
* Misc style changes, like pretty scrollbars :)
